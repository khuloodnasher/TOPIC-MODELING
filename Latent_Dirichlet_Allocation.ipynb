              "'In the Washington of 2016, even when the policy can be bipartisan, the politics cannot. And in that sense, this year shows little sign of ending on Dec. 31. When President Obama moved to sanction Russia over its alleged interference in the U. S. election just concluded, some Republicans who had long called for similar or more severe measures could scarcely bring themselves to approve. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the Obama measures ”appropriate” but also ”overdue” and ”a prime example of this administration’s ineffective foreign policy that has left America weaker in the eyes of the world.” Other GOP leaders sounded much the same theme. ”[We have] been urging President Obama for years to take strong action to deter Russia’s worldwide aggression, including its   operations,” wrote Rep. Devin Nunes,  . chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. ”Now with just a few weeks left in office, the president has suddenly decided that some stronger measures are indeed warranted.” Appearing on CNN, frequent Obama critic Trent Franks,  . called for ”much tougher” actions and said three times that Obama had ”finally found his tongue.” Meanwhile, at    and on Fox News, various spokesmen for   Trump said Obama’s real target was not the Russians at all but the man poised to take over the White House in less than three weeks. They spoke of Obama trying to ”tie Trump’s hands” or ”box him in,” meaning the   would be forced either to keep the sanctions or be at odds with Republicans who want to be tougher still on Moscow. Throughout 2016, Trump has repeatedly called not for sanctions but for closer ties with Russia, including cooperation in the fight against ISIS. Russia has battled ISIS in Syria on behalf of that country’s embattled dictator, Bashar Assad, bombing the besieged   city of Aleppo that fell to Assad’s forces this week. During the campaign, Trump even urged Russia to ”find” missing emails from the private server of his opponent, Hillary Clinton. He has exchanged public encomiums with Russian President Vladimir Putin on several occasions and added his doubts about the current U. S. levels of support for NATO  —   Putin’s longtime nemesis. There have also been suggestions that Trump’s extensive business dealings with various Russians are the reason he refuses to release his tax returns. All those issues have been disquieting to some Republicans for many months. Sens. John McCain,  . and Lindsay Graham,  . C. prominent senior members of the Armed Services Committee, have accepted the assessment of 17 U. S. intelligence agencies regarding the role of Russia in the hacking of various Democratic committees last year. That includes the FBI and CIA consensus that the Russian goal was not just to discredit American democracy but to defeat Clinton and elect Trump. They say the great majority of their Senate colleagues agree with them, and McCain has slated an Armed Services hearing on cyberthreats for Jan. 5. But the politicizing of the Russian actions  —   the idea that they helped Trump win  —   has also made the issue difficult for Republican leaders. It has allowed Trump supporters to push back on the intelligence agencies and say the entire issue is designed to undermine Trump’s legitimacy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has so far resisted calls for a select committee to look into the Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. He has said it is enough for Sen. Richard Burr,  . C. to look into it as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Typically, Republican leaders and spokesmen say there is no evidence that the actual voting or tallying on Nov. 8 was compromised, and that is true. But it is also a red herring, as interference in those functions has not been alleged and is not the focus of the U. S. intelligence agencies’ concern. For his part, Trump has shown little interest in delving into what happened. He has cast doubt on the U. S. intelligence reports to date and suggested ”no one really knows what happened.” He also has suggested that computers make it very difficult to know who is using them. This week, Trump said it was time to ”get on with our lives and do more important things.” However, at week’s end he did agree to have an intelligence briefing on the subject next week. The   has not wanted the daily intelligence briefings available to him in recent weeks, preferring that they be given to the men he has chosen as his vice president (Mike Pence) and national security adviser (Mike Flynn) with Trump taking them only occasionally. The irony of this controversy arising at the eleventh hour of the Obama presidency can scarcely be overstated, and it defines the dilemma facing both the outgoing president and the incoming party in control. Obama appears to have been reluctant to retaliate against the Russian hacking before the election for fear of seeming to interfere with the election himself. The Republicans, meanwhile, have for years called for greater confrontation with the Russians, with Obama usually resisting. Obama did join with NATO in punishing the Russians with economic sanctions over the annexation of Crimea. Those sanctions may have been painful, coming as they did alongside falling prices for oil  —   the commodity that keeps the Russian economy afloat. On other occasions, despite Russian provocations through surrogates in Syria and elsewhere, Obama did not make overt moves to force Russia’s hand. That includes occasions when Russia was believed to be hacking critical computer systems in neighboring Ukraine, Estonia and Poland. But this week, following a chorus of confirmation from the U. S. intelligence community regarding the Russian role in computer hacking in the political campaign, Obama acted. He imposed a set of mostly diplomatic actions such as sanctioning some Russian officials, closing two diplomatic compounds and expelling 35 Russian diplomats. There may have been more damaging measures taken covertly, and some Russophobes in Washington held out hope for that. But the visible portion of the program scarcely amounted to major retribution. And Putin saw fit to diminish the Obama sanctions further by declining to respond. Although his government has steadfastly denied any interference in the U. S. election, Putin rejected his own foreign minister’s recommended package of    responses. (He even sent an invitation for U. S. diplomats to send their children to a holiday party in Moscow.) That allowed Putin to appear for the moment to be ”the bigger man,” even as he spurned Obama and kept up what has looked like a public bromance with Trump, who tweeted: ”Great move on delay (by V. Putin)   I always knew he was very smart!” At the moment it may seem that the overall Russia question amounts to the first crisis facing the Trump presidency. Whether forced by this campaign interference issue or not, Trump must grasp the nettle of a relationship Mitt Romney once called the greatest threat to U. S. security in the world. To be sure, Trump needs to dispel doubts about his ability to stand up to Putin, who has bullied and cajoled his way to center stage in recent world affairs. But Trump also seems determined to turn the page on past U. S. commitments, from free trade philosophy to funding of NATO and the United Nations. And if his Twitter account is any guide, Trump shows little concern about the conundrum others perceive to be facing him. Above all, Trump has shown himself determined to play by his own rules. A year ago, many were confident that would not work for him in the world of presidential politics. We are about to find out whether it works for him in the Oval Office.'"

              "'Voters in the English city of Sunderland did something extraordinary last June. They voted by 61. 3 percent to leave the European Union, even though it put tens of thousands of local jobs at risk. Why would so many people vote against the economic interests of their hometown? The answer lies in factors that also figured in the American presidential race: opposition to immigration and a perceived threat to white identity. Sunderland’s largest private employer is the Japanese carmaker Nissan. The company first came here in the   because the United Kingdom’s membership in the EU allowed the firm to export cars to the European continent,  . Today, Nissan and its network of suppliers employ an estimated 30, 000 people in the area. By voting for Brexit, residents were threatening Nissan’s business plan. Predictably, Nissan responded with a threat of its own: no more investment unless the U. K. government offered protection from the damage that Brexit could inflict on its balance sheet. Fearful of losing a crucial employer, the U. K. pledged to help Nissan remain ”competitive,” which most people took as a promise to protect it from any costs imposed by Brexit. Nissan then announced it would put two new models in the Sunderland plant. Meanwhile, the government has not, so far, disclosed any details to the public about whether that commitment includes financial support. So the crisis has been averted for now. But for many in Sunderland, this was a cautionary tale about how populist politics can put an economy at risk. ”It caused us sleepless nights, we were depressed for weeks,” said Denise Walter, a committee member at the Philadelphia Cricket and Community Club, where some Nissan workers hang out. Sunderland is part of England’s industrial heartland  —   the equivalent of Michigan or Ohio in the U. S. Like communities in those states, Sunderland has watched industrial jobs disappear over the decades, as the city’s   business moved to East Asia and its coal mines closed. Walter saw the Brexit vote as a   wound Sunderland couldn’t afford. ”Our local [council members] have worked very hard trying to bring initiatives like this to the northeast,” she said, ”and this was just throwing everything away.” Among those who voted for Brexit were people who rely on Nissan for their livelihoods. Derek Baker works for one of Nissan’s parts suppliers and voted out because he wanted the U. K. to tighten its borders and limit immigration. Baker declined to speak with NPR, but his son, Bailey, a law student at the University of Sunderland, shared an exchange they had on the issue. Bailey Baker warned his father that by voting for Brexit, he was putting his own job at risk. ”Nissan will never leave, they’ve invested so much into the plant already,” his father replied. After Nissan threatened to halt further investment, ”He didn’t speak for a couple of days,” said Bailey Baker. ”I said, ’I told you so, Dad. ’” To appreciate what drove some of the Brexit vote here, it’s helpful to visit the Humbledon and Plains Farm Working Men’s Club, which offers pool, darts and cheap beer to a local   community. On Election Day, it also serves as a polling station. About 200 people voted here in last year’s general elections, according to local officials. Turnout for June’s Brexit referendum was nearly 40 percent higher. That caught the attention of Leslie Scott, a former city mayor who monitored the polls for the Brexit referendum. ”My lasting memory of this polling station was them coming in and saying virtually every time, ’What do we do? ’” Scott recalled. ”So, we were obviously experiencing people who’d never ever voted in their lives.” Scott also noticed voters proudly displaying patriotic symbols like the Union Jack, the flag of the United Kingdom, which some U. K. white nationalists have   in the past. ”We knew then that something was different about this election,” Scott said, referring to the Brexit vote. One recent evening, a couple of dozen   women descend on the club for country line dancing. They   and spin across the worn, parquet floor past a stage draped in American and Confederate flags. Tommy Wardropper, who is sitting in the bar, says he backed Brexit to keep foreigners out. ”We don’t want more of them coming in, Muslims, immigrants. Closing our borders would be better for our country,” says Wardropper, who works as a plumber. Wardropper followed the U. S. presidential race and is a big fan of the  : ”I love Trump, because he’s going to get rid of all the alien Muslims.” Wardropper is wearing a soccer jersey featuring a red cross on a white background. It’s known as the St. George’s Cross and serves as the flag for England, separate from the Union Jack. Wardropper is proud of his English heritage but says cherished symbols like this are increasingly under attack in multicultural Britain. ”We can’t even put the George cross in our bedroom windows!” Wardropper complains. That’s not true. Even on the drive to the club, two English flags are visible outside nearby homes. When this is pointed out, Wardropper counters: ”Well, you can [show the flag] but it upsets the Muslims.” Dan Evans, one of Wardropper’s drinking buddies, also voted for Brexit because he was tired of the United Kingdom having to follow EU law. Evans also complains that Muslims get special treatment on construction sites because of their faith. Evans spent two years building a paint factory inside the Nissan facility. Like Derek Baker, he gambled that Nissan was too heavily invested in Sunderland to shut its doors. And so far, that bet has paid off. Many here, though, wonder how long Nissan will remain committed to Sunderland and are concerned about the message the Brexit vote here sends. ”I worry about the attractiveness of any further foreign direct investment in a place like Sunderland if we are outside the European Union,” says Brian Snowdon, who teaches economics at nearby Durham University, Unlike most patrons at the working men’s club, Nigel Lee voted to stay in the European Union. Lee says support for Brexit in this community was driven by one thing above all. ”The main reason up here voted to go out was racism,” says Lee, a     . For instance, Lee says, some people resent that a nearby Muslim community keeps to itself, but fail to recognize they do it in part for their own protection. ”The Irish have done it, the Jews have done it, they all live in separate enclaves,” says Lee, nursing a whisky and lemonade. What’s clear in this community is that many are determined to keep it white  —   and were willing to put the city’s economy at risk to do so.'"

              "'The Fred Hersch Trio brings a seductive and crafty intelligence to its version of ”We See,” the Thelonious Monk tune. Articulating its melody at the piano, Hersch slips in a few leisurely pauses, which slow down and stretch out the form. Then, in the bridge, he ratchets up to twice the speed, evoking the frenetic whir of the factory machinery in Charlie Chaplin’s Modern Times. The track suggests a clever, affectionate tribute to an enduring work of art  —   and that’s before Hersch even gets around to his jaunty yet exploratory piano solo. On Sunday, Hersch could conceivably win a Grammy for that solo, and another for Sunday Night at the Vanguard, the album on which ”We See” appears. Hersch is a veteran Grammy nominee, and he’d be a deserving winner. But along with a high level of artistry, his nominations this year attest to a persistent and pervasive truth in jazz: When it comes to glittery recognition from the Recording Academy, as with broader popular acclaim, the scale is usually tipped in favor of standards. This year’s nominee pool for Best Improvised Jazz Solo also includes pianist Brad Mehldau suavely gliding through Cole Porter’s ”I Concentrate On You,” and guitarist John Scofield taking a postbop trot through Hank Williams’ ”I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry.” Joey Alexander, the    piano wunderkind, earned his seat at the table this year with ”Countdown,” a John Coltrane composition long understood as the jazz equivalent of an Olympic qualifying trial. These nominees underscore the point, reminding us of the outsize influence that a standard repertoire can hold  —   especially among a constituency searching for some criteria by which to judge. If you know ”We See”  —   a   Monk tune that nonetheless comes with the imprimatur of an acknowledged giant  —   you’re prepared to grasp the particular achievement of Hersch and his trio: Their tweaks to the song flatter your understanding, delivering a wink and a nudge. Grammy voters like that feeling, at least as much as the rest of us do. What makes a jazz standard, exactly? Broadly speaking, they’re songs in   circulation, including but not restricted to much of what we call the Great American Songbook. Jazz musicians have long grown up with this repertoire, internalizing its lessons. ”Not learning these songs puts a jazz player on a quick path to unemployment,” writes critic Ted Gioia in his 2012 book The Jazz Standards, an explicit attempt to formalize a canon. But there’s a lot more to jazz than any standard framework can accommodate. Most of the vital work now being done involves original music, in a range of expression and style. This is the benchmark rewarded by commissioning bodies, arts institutions and the more adventurous pockets of the listening public. Consider the 2016 NPR Music Jazz Critics Poll, compiled by Francis Davis. A survey of almost 140 active jazz critics worldwide, it’s among the closest things we have to an official consensus. And the best jazz album last year, according to the poll, was Old Locks and Irregular Verbs, a stormy new suite by multireedist Henry Threadgill, who also won the Pulitzer Prize for Composition last year. As with   Wadada Leo Smith, who had two albums in the Top 5, and guitarist Mary Halvorson, who came in at No. 4 (and topped my own list) Threadgill is an artist for whom the word ”original” doesn’t seem remotely sufficient. The implicit assumption is that artists like Threadgill are excluded from the Grammy conversation because of an Academy bias toward aesthetic conservatism. There’s truth to that, and not just in the jazz field. But I’ve come to believe that the issue also has a lot to do with a recognizable yardstick for accomplishment  —   or, as it happens, the lack thereof. A voter attempting to apprehend Old Locks and Irregular Verbs would have to accept the album entirely on its own terms, which of course is to Threadgill’s credit as an artist (but to his detriment at the Grammys). In addition to Hersch’s Sunday Night at the Vanguard, this year’s contenders for Best Jazz Instrumental Album include Scofield, whose Country For Old Men is a more intrepid excursion than its title would suggest pianist Kenny Barron, whose Book Of Intuition is a superb trio outing, far from complacent or ”safe” and Mehldau for Nearness, an intimate yet searching duo album with saxophonist Joshua Redman. What these albums have in common, beyond the   name value, is the inclusion of tunes that almost any   Academy member would know. Mehldau and Redman dig into some Monk, as does Barron. Scofield’s album makes unlikely jazz standards out of beloved old country songs. There are originals here too, but the presence of familiar signposts means that even a casual listener can trace his or her way through the form. It’s no accident that pianist Herbie Hancock, one of the most   jazz artists in history, received most of his awards for reinventions of one sort or another: George Gershwin, Miles Davis, Joni Mitchell. His two most recent awards were for The Imagine Project, an   crossover summit of an album, featuring a slew of pop covers. (His first two awards were in the RB field, beginning with his knockout win for ”Rockit. ”) In light of such   precedent, it’s always worth noting the exceptions. In the category of Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album, among releases devoted to Monk and The Beatles, you’ll find a pair of suites that stake out very different places in the political discourse: Real Enemies, by Darcy James Argue’s Secret Society and Presidential Suite: Eight Variations On Freedom, by the Ted Nash Big Band. But the real outlier may be back in Best Improvised Jazz Solo, where Ravi Coltrane is nominated for a lithe, impassioned soprano saxophone performance on the title track of In Movement, his album with bass guitarist Matthew Garrison and drummer Jack DeJohnette. ”In Movement” is a spontaneous composition, forged out of   interplay among the musicians. Beginning with a light shower of bass arpeggios and a blinking rhythmic loop, the piece gradually assumes a mood of shadowy intrigue, through which Coltrane’s soprano sweeps like a searchlight. The track is captivating, and duly celebrated: In Movement came in at No. 3 in the NPR poll. It would be a bold choice for a Grammy win, but don’t hold your breath. The only standard it represents is a standard of excellence, and that by itself often only gets you so far.'"
